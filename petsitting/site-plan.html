      <h3>Services</h3>
      <h4>Training</h4>
      <p>        
        Training an animal consists of teaching your pet to respond in a concrete way to a verbal command or gestural signal. Since the line that separates training from education is very fine, we explain the main differences between the two concepts.
        Canine and feline training is more than teaching your dog or cat tricks, making it sit, lie down or give you a paw, it consists of guiding your pet, educating it to improve coexistence and strengthen its bond. To do this, it is recommended to use positive canine and feline training techniques that motivate the animal and focus on guaranteeing its well-being. With us you will learn to educate your dog or cat by understanding, first, canine and feline behavior, discovering how to interpret their language and the signals they emit to indicate all their emotions. On our page you will find all the necessary information on behavior modification, basic commands, exercises, activities and training techniques.
      </p> 
      <h5>Differences between educating and training</h5>
      <p>The objective of educating a pet is to guide it during its learning from a young age so that it learns 
        to behave and adapt in different daily situations, thus making it feel safe and calm. The training 
        is intended to teach him to perform a specific action after a command.
      </p>
      <h5>The use of positive and negative reinforcement</h5>
      <p>
        During the learning process with our pet, methods are used to establish an association between 
        a stimulus and the response produced by the animal through conditioning. At the same time, 
        it's about figuring out your pet's needs and abilities to nurture them.
      </p>
      <h6>Positive reinforcement</h6>
      <p>
        It consists of giving your pet a stimulus that really motivates him, such as a prize in the 
        form of food, play, affectionate words, caresses, when he performs the desired behavior. In this way, your pet will 
        repeat the action to receive the prize again. 
      </p>
      <h6>negative reinforcement</h6>
      <p>
        It is based on removing an annoying or repulsive stimulus from your pet. For example, in the 
        case of dogs, stretch the leash against the ground so that they lie down because, as soon as they do, 
        they will stop feeling pressure. The dog will repeat the behavior again to avoid or run away from that unpleasant stimulus.
      </p>

      <h4>SPA for your pet</h4>
      <p>
        Accompany your pet during his relaxation bath, we design and create unique experiences for him.
         It is not a traditional bath, it is a spa-type bath (aroma diffuser for aromatherapy with essential 
         oils to relax, music therapy to help harmonize your senses, welcome snacks, deep shedding, exfoliation
          and hydration with a mask, relaxing massage, noise to minimize fear.
      
          While you wait for your pet, enjoy a good coffee, bring and read your favorite book, or browse social
           networks, while you wait for your pet. Live the experience of your pet in the "celebrity's 
           armchair", see and share the photos and videos of your pet on the networks. While your pet 
           waits for you, she enjoys our comfortable suites, listening to music and watching relaxation 
           videos on specialized channels for them. The colors of our spa are oriented from psychology to 
           lower anxiety levels, allowing your pet to feel comfortable and pleasant in our facilities.
      </p>
      <h4>Hairdressing</h4>
      <p>
        The dog groomer can apply an ozone soap that is given to oxygenate the skin and help kill bacteria. 
        In the next bath, the shampoo penetrates better. The circuit ends with a relaxing massage with essential oils. 
        The dog comes out like new and with healthy and shiny skin. In addition, complementary therapies such as 
        acupuncture can be contracted.

        A cat grooming session can be useful for long-haired cats such as Persian cats, so that 
        they do not get overheated or accumulate hairballs. Sanitize hair, remove dead hair.
      </p>
      <h4>walkers</h4>
      <p>
        A pet walker offers individualized walks to pets when owners, for personal or professional reasons, 
        do not have time to take their friend for a walk. The walk is a fundamental activity for your pet, it is a 
        basic need that provides physical and psychological health. Dogs that go on several hour-long 
        walks have been shown to be healthier and more receptive
