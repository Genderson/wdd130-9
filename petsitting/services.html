                <h2>Hairdressing</h2>
                <p>
                    The dog groomer can apply an ozone soap that is given to oxygenate the skin and help kill 
                    bacteria. In the next bath, the shampoo penetrates better. The circuit ends with a relaxing 
                    massage with essential oils. The dog comes out like new and with healthy and shiny skin. 
                    In addition, complementary therapies such as acupuncture can be contracted. A cat grooming 
                    session can be useful for long-haired cats such as Persian cats, so that they do not get overheated 
                    or accumulate hairballs. Sanitize hair, remove dead hair.

                    reasons, do not have time to take their friend for a walk. The walk is a fundamental 
                    activity for your pet, it is a basic need that provides physical and psychological health.
